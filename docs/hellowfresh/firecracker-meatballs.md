# Firecracker Meatballs

**Prep Time:** 15 mins
**Cook Time:** 25 mins
**Marinating:** 4 hrs

## Ingredients

- Taco Seasoning
- Fajita Seasoning
- Chili Lime Seasoning
- 1 Cup Tequila
- 1/8 Cup Olive Oil
- 1 1/2 Cup Water
- 1 Lime
- Lime Juice
- 1 Orange Pepper
- Red Onion
- 1 Tbsp Minced Garlic
- 1 Red Pepper
- Chicken Breast

## Instructions

1. Start with a container or a bag to allow the meat to marinate before cooking.
1. In a bowl or bag combine your Taco Seasoning, Fajita seasoning, Chili Lime Seasoning, Olive Oil, water, Tequila, and lime juice.  Now there isn't much of measuring it mostly depends on how seasoned you like your meat.
1. Slice up your chicken breasts into strips, you can use chicken thighs just know that the fajitas will be greaser when you cook them than if you use chicken breasts.
1. Allow the chicken to marinate  Fajita marinade for at last a couple of hours to overnight I allowed mine to set for about four hours.  The marinating will allow for the meat to get tender from the tequila and the lime.
1. Before you are ready to fire up the griddle cut up your peppers onions.
1. For Fajitas I recommend cutting the pepper into quarters and then sliced them into long slices.
1. Slice your onions into long thing sides as well.
1. When you are ready to start cooking fire up your Blackstone griddle.
1. Reoil your griddle, reoiling ensures that your griddle won't stick and that it will cook well.
1. When your griddle is hot and ready to cook turn the heat down o low.
1. Turn your heat down to low and drop the meat and marinade onto the griddle.
1. Stir your meat often using the spatulas that came in the Blackstone Griddle Accessories kit.
1. When your meat is almost done start to mix in your veggies into your meat. I made this at the same time as shrimp fajitas and steak fajitas so I spread my veggies out amongst those.
1. Cook until your veggies are tender and your meat is cooked.
1. Remove and serve!
